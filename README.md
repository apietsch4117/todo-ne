# TODO:NE

## Description

- TODO:NE is a simple TODO list application that allows you to list out things you need to do so that you can stay organized. 

- TODO:NE is a collaborative MERN-stack single-page application. It combines a scalable MongoDB back end, a GraphQL API, and an Express.js and Node.js server with a React front end. It implements user authentication with JWT to build a user-focused platform. 


## Installation

- `npm install` from the root of the project
- in the server folder, create your `.env` file using the `example.env` file
- seed the database `npm run seed`
- to start developing, `npm run develop`
- to run production, build the client (`npm run build`), then run `npm run start`.

## Usage
